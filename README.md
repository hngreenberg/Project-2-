# Aqua Down

## Description

This is an app to track when you need to water your plants. A user will sign up and create a profile. Then you can search through a database of plants. You add the plants to your profile commenting on when you got it, when you watered it, and when you last fed it. Then you update it when you water or feed or get a new plant or kill a plant.
