### Built With

<!-- TODO: List any MAJOR libraries/frameworks (e.g. React, Tailwind) with links to their homepages. -->

## Features

<!-- TODO: List what specific 'user problems' that this application solves. -->

This is an app to track when you need to water your plants. A user will sign up and create a profile. Then you can search through a database of plants. You add the plants to your profile commenting on when you got it, when you watered it, and when you last fed it. Then you update it when you water or feed or get a new plant or kill a plant. 

## Contact

<!-- TODO: Include icons and links to your RELEVANT, PROFESSIONAL 'DEV-ORIENTED' social media. LinkedIn and dev.to are minimum. -->

## Acknowledgements

<!-- TODO: List any blog posts, tutorials or plugins that you may have used to complete the project. Only list those that had a significant impact. Obviously, we all 'Google' stuff while working on our things, but maybe something in particular stood out as a 'major contributor' to your skill set for this project. -->
